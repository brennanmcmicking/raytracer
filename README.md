# RayTracer
This is an offline raytracer written in C++ from when I took CSC 305 in Fall 2022 at UVic. The sample input files are available in the test/ directory while all of the code is in the RayTracer/ directory.

# Running
`cd tests/` and run `RayTracer.exe <filename>` where the filename is one of the provided text files.

# Compiling
Open the project in Visual Studio 2019 or later. From there you can simply build as normal.
